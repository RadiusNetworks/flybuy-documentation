# White-Label Domains

Creating a white-label domain that points to a branded FlyBuy customer portal only requires a single DNS `CNAME` record to be set up on your domain. In the DNS settings for your domain (e.g., example.com) add a new `CNAME` record where the name is the white-label URL you want your customers to use when picking up their curbside orders with FlyBuy (e.g., pickup.example.com). The value of this `CNAME` record should be `whitelabel.flybuypickup.com`. After setting this up the `CNAME` record should look like this:

```
NAME                    TYPE   VALUE
----------------------------------------------------------
pickup.example.com      CNAME  whitelabel.flybuypickup.com
```

Once this is set up, provide your account rep with the name of the `CNAME` record you created so we can make sure that an SSL cert can be generated for this domain.  After that you're good to go, customers will now be directed to your white-label domain when they place orders instead of the default FlyBuy domain.

The white-label domain can also optionally be used to configure iOS Universal Links and Android App Links in your mobile apps if you've decided to integrate the FlyBuy SDK into your mobile app instead of using the FlyBuy mobile apps for your curbside solution.

# Sites API

- [API Specs](#api-specs)
- [Get A List Of All Sites](#get-a-list-of-all-sites)

The FlyBuy Sites API enables partners to fetch information about sites and associations between FlyBuy site identifiers and partner site identifiers.

## <span id="api-specs">API Specs</span>

A sample Postman collection can be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/3684da81f53275af8c22).
Example curl commands can also be found at the end of each respective section.

### Hostname

Use this hostname with the path specified in each request to get the full API URL.

```http
https://flybuy.radiusnetworks.com
```

### Headers

```http
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Token token="api-token"
```

The API token is a 48-character key associated with your account that allows access to all resources under that account.
Create and manage API tokens [here](https://account.radiusnetworks.com/personal_tokens).

The API token is different from webhook and SDK tokens. If you require a webhook or SDK token, please reach out to your FlyBuy customer success representative.

```http
GET /api/v1/sites
```

This returns a paginated response of all sites that the owner of the API key has access to.
This can span multiple projects and sites.

Use the `pages.next` URL provided in the response body for the next page of results.

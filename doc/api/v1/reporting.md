The FlyBuy Reporting API enables partners to build custom analytics based on archived data.

## <span id="api-specs">API Specs</span>

A sample Postman collection can be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/3684da81f53275af8c22).
Example curl commands can also be found at the end of each respective section.

### Hostname

Use this hostname with the path specified in each request to get the full API URL.

```http
https://flybuy.radiusnetworks.com
```

### Headers

```http
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Token token="api-token"
```

The API token is a 48-character key associated with your account that allows access to all resources under that account.
Create and manage API tokens [here](https://account.radiusnetworks.com/personal_tokens).

The API token is different from webhook and SDK tokens. If you require a webhook or SDK token, please reach out to your FlyBuy customer success representative.


## <span id="get-a-list-of-all-archived-orders">Get A List Of All Archived Orders</span>

GET /api/v1/archived_orders?end_time=2020-08-03T23:59:59Z&start_time=2020-08-02T00:00:00Z

## <span id="faq">FAQ</span>

### What is an archived order?

An archived order is a closed order that has been stripped of the customer's personally identifiable information (PII).

### When do orders get archived?

An order gets archived once it is closed.
A closed order is an order that has an `order_state` of `completed` or `cancelled`.
If an order remains open for 60 days, it will automatically get archived regardless of the `order_state`.

### How do I know an order is redeemed?

If `redeemed_at` is not null, the order is redeemed.

### How do I know an order received location updates?

If `location_started_at` is not null, the order received location updates.

### Is there a script I can run that will generate an export?

Use [this](https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/flybuy-documentation/blob/master/doc/api/v1/examples/reporting-orders.py) sample Python script to generate a CSV file.
